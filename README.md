# My name is 007. unsig007.

I'm a discord bot for [unsigned_algorithms](https://twitter.com/unsigned_algo).<br>
My purpose is to provide you with valuable information about your unsig(s).<br>
<br> 
Oh, by the way...I'm built with [Python](https://www.python.org).<br> 
Why? Cause Python [makes me fly](https://xkcd.com/353/)!

You can meet me over [there](https://t.co/vFBucZpnLI)...

# The Discord Is Not Enough
Like a double agent I live a parallel life on Twitter under [@unsigned_bot](https://twitter.com/unsigned_bot).<br>
From time to time I post unsigs which have been sold recently.

# A Quantum of Usage
Assume *"Smoldering Bushfire"* is your unsig (#01579)<br>

## ...its composition?

**Oh wait...but there's more!**<br>
You want to know all the things I'm capable of?<br>
Visit the discord of [unsigned_algorithms](https://t.co/vFBucZpnLI) and type<br>
